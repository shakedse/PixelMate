PixelMate is an image processing system built in Java.
The system takes a configuration file (config.json), an input image (input.png), and applies a series of operations (like adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and applying box blur) to generate a processed output image (output.png).

Key Features
Brightness, Contrast, Saturation – Enhance image quality with configurable values.
Box Blur – Smooth the image using a defined blur area.
User-Friendly Configuration – Control the processing with a simple JSON file.
Processed Output – Generates a processed image ready for use.
